## Advocating for Undergraduate Research & Institutions

**I am an advocate for primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUI)** - both as environments that are positioned to confront society's most pressing sociotechnical problems, and also as institutions that offer a compelling balance of teaching and research for new faculty. I curate a [PUI job ad website](https://cs-pui.github.io/), [write/give talks about working at PUIs](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422), and frequently mentor graduate students about the PUI hiring landscape.

**I also advocate for _undergraduate research_** within my scholarly community, and see undergrad researchers as a critical (but often overlooked) group within academia. I believe that we need to [interrogate our selection processes and success metrics](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/a-student-centered-research-manifesto-bfb41072fdca) in undergraduate research, [mitigate academia's barriers to participation](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/a-neglected-pipeline-removing-undergrad-barriers-to-conferences-2a6c87eb4176), and view undergraduate research as a critical opportunity for enriching the perspectives in our research communities.
