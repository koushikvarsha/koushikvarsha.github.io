### About me

I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science at Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/curriculum/catalog/departmental/computer-science/index.html), and previously received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) from the University of Colorado Boulder. My research draws on the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. I explore design approaches to create customizable everyday assistive systems. I believe in _computer science for everyone_. 

I also co-maintain the [cs-pui website](https://cs-pui.github.io/), created by [Dr. Evan Peck](https://evanpeck.github.io/). It's a curated lists of CS faculty jobs at primarily undergraduate instituitions.

**Students:** I am always looking for students to work with me on research projects, both during the summer, as well as, during the year. I love chatting with you about all things computer science! Please setup up a <a href="https://calendly.com/vkoushik/20min" style="color:black">**meeting**</a> or contact me at vkoushik@coloradocollege.edu.
