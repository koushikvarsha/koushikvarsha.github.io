I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/dept/mathcs/) at Colorado College. Previously, I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/). My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Accessibility. I explore design approaches to create customizable everyday assistive systems. I believe that <i>computer science is for everyone</i>!

<p> <strong>Students:</strong> I am always looking for students to work with me on research projects, both during the summer, as well as, during the year. I love chatting with you about all things computer science! Please stop by my office <i>TSC 206E</i> or contact me at vkoushik@coloradocollege.edu.
