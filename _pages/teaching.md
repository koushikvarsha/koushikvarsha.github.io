# Teaching Experience 

## Courses at Colorado College 

**CP 115: Computational Thinking** \
This is the first course in the introductory sequence of computer science. It is taught in Python and teaches foundational programming concepts. 

**CP 122: Computer Science 1** \
Being the third course in the introductory sequence of computer science, CP 122 introduces object-oriented programming in Java.

**CP 274: Software Design** \
This course provides insights into industry software processing models and tools. Students learn OOP design patterns in Java, git, agile/scrum processes, and work on a large data management system with a group. 

**CP 341: Foundations of Human-Centered Computing** \
I run a flipped clasroom to teach the foundational building blocks of human-centered design and design thinking. Students work on week-long design sprints to create interactive prototypes following the user-centered design process. Check out the [CC story](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/newsevents/newsroom/2023/cc-course-emphasizes-human-computer-interaction-through-hands-on-learning.html) about this class in Fall 2023.

**CSCI 449: Team Software Project** \
The capstone course for our undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science. In this course, studenst are expected to work in teams and consult with clients and a deliver a software application. 

## Courses at CU Boulder 

**CSCI 1300: Computer Science 1: Starting Computing** \
Introduces fundamental techniques of programming through C++. Students work on weekly homeworks, recitation activities and apply skills learned in skills on a larger final project. 

**CSCI 3002: Foundations of Human-Centered Computing** \
Students get introduced to the user-centered design process and follow an iterative design process to create a medium-fidelity prototype.
