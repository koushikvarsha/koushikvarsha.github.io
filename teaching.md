**CP122** _Computer Science 1_<br>
This [course](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/curriculum/catalog/courses/cp122.html) is one of the entry points into the CS major at Colorado College. It introduces object-oriented programming in Java. All majors are required to take this course, but often students across the college take CS 1.

**CP274** _Software Design_<br>
[Dan Ellsworth](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/basics/contact/directory/people/ellsworth_dan.html) and I designed a flipped-classroom [software design course]((https://www.coloradocollege.edu/academics/curriculum/catalog/courses/cp274.html)) simulating a real-world industry experience. Students learned Object Oriented Design Patterns, git and databases. Students completed three design sprints, developing large software systems with a group.
